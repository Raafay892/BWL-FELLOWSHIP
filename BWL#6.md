Linux has been around since the mid-1990s and has since reached a user-base that spans the globe. Linux is actually everywhere: It’s in your phones, your thermostats, in your cars, refrigerators, Roku devices, and televisions. It also runs most of the Internet, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and the world’s stock exchanges.
Linux is also distributed under an open source license.
Open source follows these key tenets:
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
Popular Linux distributions include:

LINUX MINT
MANJARO
DEBIAN
UBUNTU
ANTERGOS
SOLUS
FEDORA
ELEMENTARY OS
OPENSUSE
And don’t think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you can turn to:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Ubuntu Server
Centos
SUSE Enterprise Linux
