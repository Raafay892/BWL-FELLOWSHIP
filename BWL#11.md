##CRYPTOGRAPHY##

Cryptography : is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. 
More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.

WORKING OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
TEXT MESSAGE CONVERTED INTO NUMERIC FORM WITH ENCRYPTION KEY
CIPHER TEXT
DECRYPTION KEY THEN CIPHER TEXT AS PARAMETER 
FINALLY A MESSAGE

Cryptography is further classified into 
symmetric key and assymetric key
symmetric is further classified into classical and modern cryptography
Transposition Ciphers:
In Cryptography, a transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext. 
Substitution Cipher :
Method of encryption by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the “units” may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. 
Stream Cipher :
Symmetric or secret-key encryption algorithm that encrypts a single bit at a time. With a Stream Cipher, the same plaintext bit or byte will encrypt to a different bit or byte every time it is encrypted.
Block Cipher :
An encryption method that applies a deterministic algorithm along with a symmetric key to encrypt a block of text, rather than encrypting one bit at a time as in stream ciphers.
RSA is the most widely used form of public key encryption, 
RSA Algorithm :
RSA stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman, inventors of this technique
Both public and private key are interchangeable
Variable Key Size (512, 1024, or 2048 bits)
